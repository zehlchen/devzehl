# The Zehl Story
I have a rather fantastical and disjointed juxtaposition of events to recount, but my memory of them is biased from
the perspective of the narrator.

## Chapter 1: Subtle Hints and Intimations of Humor and Lexicon
I'm frequently (self-)admonished for using certain choice four-letter words on a regular basis. It's a habit that
I'm trying to kick, so I beg you please bear with me.

I'm a natural goofball, but my humor has been influenced over the years by the repetitious playback of skits and
routines from the recorded HBO specials of Robin Williams, Chris Rock, and George Carlin. I have listened to them 
so many times, in fact, that I have them mostly committed to memory, and will happily begin reciting entire scenes
from film and stand-up routines if the feeling is just right.  

If I had to describe my wit, it would be with some obtuse analogy, so I won't. Especially as I often recount moments
in my life with an eye on the ironic and satirical, and like to draw parallels between my life and handful of quality 
*Dad jokes*. I am known to have told at least a dozen *inappropriate* or *mistimed* jokes in my life.

## Chapter 2: Affirming Chronic Social Isolation
Suffice it to say, I'm not going to go into elaborate detail about my own struggle with mental illness, but I think it
is worth saying, and repeating loudly, that social isolation is a part of the collateral complications imposed by prolonged
struggles with serious mental illness. There are a number of ways out of that isolation, and you, captive audience, are
reading the one that I found works best for me!

Now that I've restored the ability to glimpse a part of my life in the rearview mirror, I can proudly say that it doesn't
matter what the diagnosis is, or even if there is one, the struggle is unpalatable, real, and so intrinsically human.
The gift of sentience, of self-cognition, could be perturbed like a stone into a placid lake. And we all have, in one way
or another, experienced these wave-like particles of struggle, each with their own unique ripples.
