# The Zehl Story
I have a rather fantastical and disjointed juxtaposition of events to recount, but my memory of them is biased from
the perspective of the narrator.

## Subtle Hints and Intimations of Humor and Lexicon
I'm frequently (self-)admonished for using certain choice four-letter words on a regular basis. It's a habit that
I'm trying to kick, so I beg you please bear with me.

I'm a natural goofball, but my humor has been influenced over the years by the repetitious playback of skits and
routines from the recorded HBO specials of Robin Williams, Chris Rock, and George Carlin. I have listened to them 
so many times, in fact, that I have them mostly committed to memory, and will happily begin reciting entire scenes
from film and stand-up routines if the feeling is just right.  

If I had to describe my wit, it would be with some obtuse analogy, so I won't. Especially as I often recount moments
in my life with an eye on the ironic and satirical, and like to draw parallels between my life and handful of stale 
*Dad jokes*. I am known to have told at least a dozen *inappropriate* or *mistimed* jokes in my life.
