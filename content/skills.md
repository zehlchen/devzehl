# IT & Developer Experience
My relationship with computers began in 1989 when I learned how to type on a QWERTY keyboard at the same time as
I was learning the alphabet and how to read. My family purchased a computer in 1991 through a grant from the 
Defense Department's EFMP, a Packard Bell Legend series Pentium desktop. I created my first AOL Account in 1993.

## C99 & C++11
I started with C in 1994 studying the `/usr/src` directory of the FreeBSD operating system. In 1998, I came into
possession of K&R's *The C Programming Language*. I started learning C++ in 1997 when I began using Borland C++ 
Builder and Microsoft Visual C++.

My first UNIX was Linux, and the distribution was Slackware on FAT16, U-MSDOS file system, because it was the most

my father use his credit card online to pay for installation media!
