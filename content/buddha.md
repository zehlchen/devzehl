# With Regard to a Higher Power
The **Buddha** and the **Green Molecule** refer to **tetrahydrocannabinol** (THC), the psychoactive compound 
found naturally in *cannabis indica* and *cannabis sativa*.

## Cannabis Laws within the Commonwealth of Virginia
The [Cannabis Control Authority](https://www.cca.virginia.gov/) maintains a website with an abundance of useful
knowledge, including links to the laws as they appear within the [Code of Virginia](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode). 
Understanding the legal implications of having a relationship with cannabis is extremely important, especially if 
you value your liberty. There are still many misdemeanors and felonies that still apply to offenses involving cannabis. 
The last thing anyone needs is to get jammed up with the authorities over a simple misunderstanding or technicality.

## Medical Cannabis Certification in Virginia (2024)
The final result of this process is the issuance of a digital document by the state called a 
**"CERTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS"**. 

Medical cannabis cards are available but are no longer required for a **certified patient** to purchase cannabis 
from a legal dispensary. The certification is valid for one year and is effective immediately. The dispensary will
have you forward the PDF document you obtained from your provider to them for their records.

Purchasing cannabis **requires a valid Virginia state identification or driver's license**
each time you go to the dispensary; you will also be required to pay with **cash** or **direct debit**. If the latter
method is chosen, a surcharge is applied both from the dispensary and your bank.

The certification process is quite straightforward and can be done remotely with a properly licensed nurse 
practitioner, physician's assistant, or medical doctor (MD/DO). This cannot be just any prescriber, however: they must 
be credentialed by the Board of Medicine to certify patients for medicinal cannabis use. Most providers who do this
sort of thing on the regular don't accept insurance, and I've seen appointment prices range between $100 to $150.

Prepare to provide documentation of the condition for which you are seeking medicinal certification. I provided
screenshots of my prescription history and pictures of my medicine bottles of the medications used to treat my 
conditions. Chances are you already have a condition that could benefit from the use of cannabis, you'll just have to
provide some anecdotal evidence that you are receiving a medical benefit that goes beyond the implied recreational 
context.

## Shenanigans within the [DynaVerse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynavap)
I am extremely satisfied with my decision to experiment DynaVap's dry herb vaporizers. After nine months of daily use,
I claim to be as familiar with my device as a seventeenth-century soldier and his trusty musket, which itself speaks great 
volumes to its ease of use considering just how clumsy I am. I recommend you procure a simple heat sink, especially if you 
plan to use this vape frequently.

**Vaporizers**
 * [Stainless Steel M+](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/m) is an excellent entry-level device with plenty
 of features to offer the novice capper. 
 * [Omni](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/omni) is a luxury purchase that has paid back its dividends in reliability
  time and again.
 * [Titanium M+](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/m) is my favorite and the hardest-hitting of the three devices. 

 **Accessories and add-ons**
 * [Armored Cap](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/caps) a must-have if you plan on doing this frequently.
 * [Titanium Helix](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/tips) an exquisitely crafted and well-thought upgrade.
