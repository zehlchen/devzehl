# Respecting the Buddha

I have never *intentionally* smoked marijuana; I've only ever *accidentally* combusted it. Still, as a 
responsible consumer, I don't relish the idea of wasting any of the precious cannabinoids, so as a matter
of principle, naturally, I'll inhale it. Even though I find the smoke intrusive and obnoxious, it does
serve as the occasional reminder that nothing worth perfecting should ever be taken for granted.

## Calculating the Cost of THC
To find out how much you are paying per gram of THC, multiply the total weight by the concentration percentage 
of the measured THC and divide this by the price. Once you calculate this for the various methods of consumption
(flower, resin, hash, edible, tincture), you can infer the least expensive way possible to enjoy yourself. I keep 
a little spreadsheet with the latest prices from my dispensary so that I can compare them to the pricing of THC 
in other parts of the world. After all, a penny saved is still a penny earned!

## One-Hit Extraction with the VapCap
A [VapCap](https://dynavap.com/) is a small elongated device (a hollowed-out cylinder 10 millimeters in diameter
by 100 millimeters in length). On one end is a bowl accommodating up to 125 milligrams (by weight) of flower. A
copper cap is placed over the bowl to protect the contents from a direct flame and is then heated (by conduction)
with a soft or torch flame until the cap, which contains two slightly concave bi-metal discs, makes an audible
click when it reaches 180 and 200 degrees Celsius, at which point the heat is immediately discontinued. The user
then draws air through the cylinder to cool and finally complete the cycle. With the correct distribution of heat,
and the requisite timing, one can achieve nirvana and inhale almost all the vaporized cannabinoids.

### Newbie-to-Newbie Advice
I haven't been doing this for *years*, but I feel like I have a firm grasp on exactly what goes where and when. I
have a few considerations, if I may:
  1. The M+ gives a hotter hit than an Omni because of its short vapor path and increased condenser surface area.
  2. The Armored Cap is Game Genie of the Dynaverse because it trivializes the heating process. Even more so when
     using a multi-flame torch.
  3. Clear out the vessel chamber quickly after each use to avoid the herb reabsorbing moisture and requiring
     maintenance. 
  4. Don't combust -- I mean, you will, but don't do it.
  5. Unless you have a thermal imaging camera or laser thermometer, your guess with carryover heat is as good as 
     mine. Still, I wouldn't dilly-dally ... once it's heated, take the hit!
  6. The bowl has a serrated edge that allows for it to be used like a grinder and a straw.

I use an Omni condenser and stem with a Helix tip and the Armored cap. This is for sure the way to go for clean,
smooth one hit wonders. Nothing flower-related hits as hard as a well-timed VapCap hit!

## Keeping Your Tolerance Low: Tolerance Breaks
I learned some valuable lessons on tolerance when I went from using high-potency 510-cartridges (86% THC) to 
low-potency flower (19% THC): the former builds tolerance much faster than the latter. Since flower is the least-
expensive form of THC in my jurisdiction, I have found that taking breaks every once in a while (abstaining) helps
to reset the sensitivity to THC and other cannabinoids in the brain. This advice is directed mostly at those who
consume at regular intervals for medicinal purposes.

## The Session Vibe with Air Max
The [Arizer Air Max](https://arizer.com/) is a 18650-battery powered electric ceramic heater that allows the user
to heat a glass bowl ("stem") of flower to the user's desired temperature. There are several advantages to the
Air Max that make it perfect for a session. It doesn't hit particularly hard, but the cumulative effect has a 
creeping feeling to it. It has a nice weight to it with the battery in it, but sans the battery it feels very
lightweight and unsubstantial. I didn't consider my options well enough before I made this my first vape purchase.
