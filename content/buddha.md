# The 4:20 to Bedlam
**The Buddha** and **the Green Molecule** refers to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or the psychoactive compound 
found in the plant *cannabis indica* and *cannabis sativa*. Mankind has used these plants for their medicinal
properties since the dawn of recorded history.

## Cannabis Laws within the Commonwealth of Virginia
The [Cannabis Control Authority](https://www.cca.virginia.gov/) maintains a website with links to the laws as they
are written in the [Code of Virginia](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode). Understanding the legal aspects of
having a relationship with cannabis is extremely important, especially if you value your liberty. There are still
many misdemeanors and felonies that still apply to offenses involving cannabis. The last thing anyone needs is to
get jammed up with the authorities over a simple misunderstanding or technicality. 

## Medical Cannabis Certification in Virginia (2024)
The final result of this process is the issuance of a digital document by the state called a 
**"CERTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS"**. 

Medical cannabis cards are available but are no longer required for a **certified patient** to purchase cannabis 
from a legal dispensary. The certification is valid for one year and is effective immediately. The dispensary will
have you forward the PDF document to them for their records. Purchasing cannabis **requires a valid Virginia state identification or driver's**
every time you go to the dispensary; you will also be required to pay with **cash** or **direct debit** (like an ATM)
and yes, there is a surcharge.

The certification process is very straightforward and can be done remotely with a properly credentialed nurse 
practitioner, physician's assistant, or medical doctor (MD/DO). This cannot be just any prescriber, however: they must 
be specially-credentialed by the Board of Medicine to certify patients for medicinal cannabis use. The "visit" is not
covered by insurance, so be prepared to pay out of pocket every year.

Prepare to provide documentation of the condition for which you are seeking medicinal certification. I provided
screenshots of my prescription history and pictures of my medicine bottles of the medications used to treat my 
conditions. Chances are you already have a condition that could benefit from the use of cannabis.

## Shenanigans with the [DynaVap Omni](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/omni) & [DynaVap Titanium M+](https://www.dynavap.com/collections/m) 
I use almost exclusively a butane-powered vaporizer from DynaVap to medicate with dry herb (the safest and most 
cost-effective way to medicate with cannabis in my locality).
