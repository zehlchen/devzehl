# Coffee, Cannabis, and Coding

## Coffee

## Cannabis (The Green Molecule)
**I have never smoked cannabis (intentionally)!** There is a tool for every job, and getting high has never been easier!

**Use Case** | **Recommendation** | **Notes**
:---: | :---: | ---
Dry, Butane | **[DynaVap](https://dynavap.com/) Omni** | Easy one-hit extractions |
Dry, Battery | **[Arizer](https://arizer.com/) Air Max** | More of a session vibe |
510, Live Resin | **[Vessel](https://vesselbrand.com) Expedition** | Compact and on-the-go |

### Microdosing for the Medicinal Practitioner
You know there are a lot of reasons people use cannabis. While getting high is undeniably pleasant, the goal of having
a healthy relationship with the Green Molecule is to promote wellness. I think as part of daily routine, cannabis can
offer clear benefits that some traditional (pharmaceutical) medication cannot. And it's a hell of a lot cheaper.

### Super-heated but not Combusted
Enjoying the benefits of cannabis comes at some risk to those who would inhale its carcinogenic smoke. A better way to
partake is using a dry-herb vaporizer or even a concentrated (albeit *processed*) formulation. Avoiding combustion is
not always feasible, and for that I recommend quartz or glassware.

### Keep It Simple, Stupid!
I don't think a complicated regimen is needed. I think moderation is absolutely essential. I think using cannabis can
teach responsibility and accountability, especially when it comes time to measure. Whatever you do, do it with excellence.
