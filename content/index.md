[Salaam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-salamu_alaykum) & [Grüß Gott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BC%C3%9F_Gott)!

I'm delighted that you've taken the time to visit me on the great WWW. If you should have any feedback, comments, or suggestions,
I would kindly encourage you to acquaint yourself with my prominently display social media buttons. There are other ways, and
if you should choose to reach out, rest assured I will do my best to make the connection and respond.

Since I'm paying for the bandwidth, the cloud server, domain name, etc., I reserve the right to claim this forum as my own bully
pulpit. Still, I respect you and your privacy, and I will keep the content mostly PG-13, certainly nothing that you should be
ashamed of reading! I hope to provide a perspective that is positive and well-balanced, thoughtful and honest, and, most
importantly, rich with humor and charisma!

So, try on my website for size, and if you're not 100% satisfied by the quality, you may return it for a full refund.
