# My Little Demon Cast A Spell On You!

[Salaam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-salamu_alaykum) & [Grüß Gott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BC%C3%9F_Gott)!

I'm so delighted that you've taken the time to visit me on the Great Network. You have discovered **My Little Demon**, my 
personal playground in the cloud. This site functions as a bridge between the idle rantings of my fingers on the keyboard
and a place where I can give my take on subjects ranging from my perspective as a part-time skeptic to the delusional rants
of a paranoid former pirate and cybercriminal. *Don't worry, I've been on the wagon for some time now.*

**I have created this establishment as a safe haven for bits of all parity, one and zero alike!**

Please rest assured that your participation in this conspiracy (and other such experiments, as they may occur) will be kept
with the strictest confidence. While I promise not to disclose any of your data to third parties, I can't promise that I'm
not going to barter your digital soul in a deal with the aforementioned demon. Enjoy responsibly!
