# Coffee, Cannabis, and Coding

Welcome, [Grüß Gott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BC%C3%9F_Gott)!

If you're reading this, I reckon you've either clicked a link in a profile somewhere, or you got seriously off
track in a Bing or Google search! No matter! I can't promise there won't be controversy, but there's always a
risk on the 'net.

Whatever your dysfunction, I do thank you for visiting my server and hope you find the content stimulating.
